Can be recovered from [[plutonium-240|Plutonium-240]]-rich spent [[RBMK]] fuels, as well as certain types of [[zirconium|Zirconium]] fast breefer fuels. Only used in specialized breeding fuels and as high enriched fuel, which is more powerful than its [[plutonium-239|Plutonium-239]] counterpart. Plutonium-241 in RBMKs yields [[americium-241|Americium-241]] and [[americium-242|Americium-242]] when reprocessed.<br><br>Highly radioactive."
